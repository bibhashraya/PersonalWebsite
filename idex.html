                    <p> Hello! I'm bibhash and this section is about me and my persnoal details. 
                        I was born in on january 11, 2004 in Bhaktapur or I can say Patan hospital to be precise 
                        and my home town is Bhaktapur. I have already completed my higher secondary of education and +2 level.
                        Currently approaching my bachelor's degree in computer science at Herald College and as a part of a assignment, I have made this 
                        website through my own understanding of things. This is a simple Portfolio website and also the first website made by me. I have zero
                        work experience on any field. I had some interest on IT field so I joined Herald collge to approach my bachelors degree. I have big goals 
                        but I still don't knwo where shoudl I start from.
                        <br><br>
                        <h2>Education:</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p> I completed my Distict Level Examintaion in 2016.
                            I gave my examination from Genuine Secondary School, 
                            Dekoch, Bhaktapur. I scored a GPA of 3.4 in my DLE
                            (District Level Examination). At GESS I made many good
                            friends and also had genuine connections between me and
                            my teachers. Then again I completed my SEE(Secondary Level Examination)from
                            the same school by scoring 3.9 GPA.
                            <br>
                            Then I approached to complete my +2 degree from Global School of science and It went good.
                            I scored 3.45 overall which is not bad as I expected it to be. I made a lot of friends and had a good time
                            learning new things.
