                    <p> Hello! I'm bibhash and this section is about me and my persnoal details. 
                        I was born in on january 11, 2004 in Bhaktapur or I can say Patan hospital to be precise 
                        and my home town is Bhaktapur. I have already completed my higher secondary of education and +2 level.
                        Currently approaching my bachelor's degree in computer science at Herald College and as a part of a assignment, I have made this 
                        website through my own understanding of things. This is a simple Portfolio website and also the first website made by me. I have zero
                        work experience on any field. I had some interest on IT field so I joined Herald collge to approach my bachelors degree. I have big goals 
                        but I still don't knwo where shoudl I start from.
